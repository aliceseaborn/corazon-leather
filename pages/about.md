## Enjoy Corazón Leather as spectator, contestant, volunteer, or sponsor!

Corazón Leather &#8482; is New Mexico's premier leather and kink contest. It brings together disparate folks who might have nothing in common save for an interest in kinky sex and Leather culture.

Are you ready to leave the mundane behind? Does the thought of helpless men bound and gagged fascinate you? Can you explore pain? Would the sight of a woman bitching orders to her sex slaves focus your attention? Would adults acting like animals interest you? Does danger turn you on? Are you tired of hiding your inner freak? Don't be shy. You might like what you find. 

Corazón Leather is looking for good people who are willing and able to share their thoughts, effort, and time in the pursuit of fun in our community. If that's you this contest is yours. Keep clicking, you kinky fucker, to find out more!
