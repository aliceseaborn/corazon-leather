Being a contestant in our event will be fun, give you experience, great memories, and better connect you to our community. Like any title, it's not always about winning. The experience and connection to community is what matters.

Come join us! This page will help you understand more about our event and how it works.


## Interested in running for the title?

Do you like serving? How about doing things for others? Does travel interest you? Performing and fund-raising? Do you enjoy any of the former in a kinky context? Corazón Leather is looking for someone like you! As New Mexico's premier Leather contest, Corazón title holders pride themselves on the four tenets of Leather culture: Honesty, Integrity, Loyalty and Trust, with a healthy dose of community service and good old fashioned kinky fun. We work to unite all parts of our kinky community, from Leather Daddies to Pet Players, and everyone in between.  This is a chance to entertain, organize, and lead a rambunctious crew with unspeakable interests. Interested?

## I won! I won! Now What?

Congratulations! Community service is a big obligation for Corazón Leather titleholders. As this is a working title, we ask three things of each winner:

1. Be involved with two NM Leather / Kink events throughout the year. These can be as simple as volunteering at the next event, or as complex as joining a board.
2. Participate in next year's Corazón Leather event as a judge and/or performer.
3. With every shenanigan you undertake, aspire to the highest ethical standard. Corazón title holders are leaders in the leather/kink/queer community, and must strive for excellence in their freaky shit.

You will have assistance with the fund-raisers, though you are expected to produce ideas and take on the lion's share of planning and implementation. Should you choose to travel to an event, there may be some funds available to assist. You will still need to raise funds for travel expenses.
