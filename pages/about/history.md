### 2023 - Stellar

![Stellar](/_images/titleholders/stellar.jpeg "Stellar, Mr. Corazón Leather 2023")

Stellar is passionate about everything spooky, primal, sadist, and dominant. This includes honing his kinky crafts. He's been involved in the leather/kink community for 13 years. In this time one of the most rewarding roles has been as a Top. He enjoys hearing the crack of a whip and the thud of a paddle while exploring power play limits with a his bottom.

Stellar is originally from South Carolina, and has been in New Mexico for the last six years. He has enjoyed providing service to alternative communities, including volunteering in the New Mexico kink community, and volunteering with different dungeons and organizations in Illinois and Texas.

Stellar believes that community inclusion and education is an extremely important service to provide awareness in the leather and kink community. He takes pride in contributing to this education by teaching classes about kink, fetishes, safe play, primal/prey, and tantric play.

He strives to be kind and light-hearted in all of his community interactions, and embraces his eccentric nature openly.

### 2023 - Lash Onyx

I've been active in the local and national leather community for five years. I am the 2019 New Mexico Leather Bear, representing the Land of Enchantment, and a proud member of Onyx Men of Color, Onyx Lone Star.

I flag left navy blue, yellow, red, white, gray, black, and orange. I am switch in impact play and electro play. I love bare-handed spanking impact play as a top.

Over the last few years, I have attended dozen events in several states, including New Mexico, virtual events, which have enhance my knowledge and experience in BDSM, Kink, and the Leather Lifestyle.

With my husband, Bear Mike, presented workshops on Better BDSM with Passion and Improving
