## Owner/Producer - Jayson DaBoi

Bootblack, spazzed-out Stitch puppy, and auction assistant extraordinaire, Jayson DaBoi loves to help and will pimp out his skills for any worthy Leather cause. Hard work is putty in Jayson's capable, boot-greased hands; he welcomes new challenges with gusto.
Friends know this New Mexico native as a loyal, shenanigan-inspiring, and fun-loving Leather Boi. While his woof and kilt bring all the boots to the yard, his heart and spirit keep them there. His soul soars in the sacred space he creates with fellow Leather Folk when working on boots, vests, chaps, or a tightly laced corset. Jayson is devoted to bringing the ~~boobs~~-*leather*, bringing the LEATHER back to life! The labor of love of leather fills his cup as well as the cups of so many who learn from, teach, support, and uplift him!
As International Ms. Bootblack 2010, Jayson served with the belief that boots create a spiritual foundation of the Leather Walk and that everyone deserves access to a solid, beautiful, and polished foundation. Currently, Jayson produces the Coraz√≥n Leather Contest in his beloved New Mexico where he's also the Official Bootblack of the Albuquerque Eagle. He runs the bootblack stands at various Leather and kink events throughout his home state and region.
Jayson is married to a beautiful girl who somehow manipulated the time-space continuum with her wily ways to get Jayson to be still long enough to see around his lens as an insatiable flirt, boisterous bootblack, and driven Leather Boi. He's her Owner, she's his property, and her love illuminates his champion heart above all else!
Jayson's nights are rich with laughter, love, and support at Leather events. Most importantly, Jayson DaBoi enjoys this precious life and celebrates ohana. He'd love for you to say *hi* so he can give back a proper WOOF.
