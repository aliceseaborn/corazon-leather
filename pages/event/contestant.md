Being a contestant in our event will be fun, give you experience, great memories, and better connect you to our community. Like any title, it's not always about winning. The experience and connection to community is what matters.

Come join us! This page will help you understand more about our event and how it works.


## Interested in running for the title?

Do you like serving? How about doing things for others? Does travel interest you? Performing and fund-raising? Do you enjoy any of the former in a kinky context? Corazón Leather is looking for someone like you! As New Mexico's premier Leather contest, Corazón title holders pride themselves on the four tenets of Leather culture: Honesty, Integrity, Loyalty and Trust, with a healthy dose of community service and good old fashioned kinky fun. We work to unite all parts of our kinky community, from Leather Daddies to Pet Players, and everyone in between.  This is a chance to entertain, organize, and lead a rambunctious crew with unspeakable interests. Interested?


## Titleholders & Requirements of our titleholders.

There are up to two winners for this title. They may be of any gender identity and/or leather identity. We ask title holders to participate in a minimum of two events as a Corazón Leather title holder, and participate in the next Corazón Leather competition. More details below.


## Who produces the contest?

Corazón Leather is New Mexico's premier pansexual kink title, produced by Jayson DaBoi Johnson and his crew of many volunteers.


## Judges

Our judging panel is made up of esteemed guests and members of various local leather/kink communities. The judging panel will be announced Friday night. See more about our judges on the [event](http://www.corazonleathernm.com/index.php/event) page.

### Scoring

The two highest scoring contestants, with a minimum of 60 points each, will be awarded as the 2022 Corazón Leather Leaders. Judges will score contestants on the following criteria:

|            Category           |        Points       |
|:-----------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Application                   | 5 points            |

| Fantasy                       | 25 points           |

Tallies will be calculated through Averaged Raw Scoring: All scores will be added together then divided by the number of judges (5). The two highest-scoring contestants will be named as the 2024 Corazón Leather Titleholders!
In case of a tie, the contestant with the highest scoring interview will be selected as the winner. If *this* score is a tie, **the head judge will make the final decision.**

## I won! I won! Now What?

Congratulations!

Community service is a big obligation for Corazón Leather titleholders. As this is a working title, we ask three things of each winner:

1. Be involved with at least four NM Leather / Kink / LGBTQIA+ events throughout the year.  These can be as simple as volunteering at the next event, or as complex as joining an organization board. One of these must be organizing/producing a fundraiser for a non-profit of your choice.
2. Participate in next year’s Corazón Leather event for your Step-Aside.
3. With every shenanigan you undertake, aspire to the highest ethical standard. Corazón title holders are leaders in the leather/kink/queer community and must strive for excellence in their freaky shit.

You will have assistance with any fundraisers, though you are expected to produce ideas and take on the lion’s share of planning and implementation.  Should you choose to travel to an event, there may be some funds available to assist.  You will still need to raise funds for travel expenses. A pass to the Southwest Master/slave Contest is provided. This event is held in July in Colorado Springs. Please let the producer know if you do not plan to attend.
